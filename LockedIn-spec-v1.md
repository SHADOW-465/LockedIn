# FINAL REVISED PROJECT LOCKEDIN SPECIFICATION

_Comprehensive Single Source of Truth for the LockedIn Application_

> NOTE: This document consolidates **all** previously discussed specifications plus the latest refinements. It is intentionally exhaustive and detailed so it can be handed directly to engineers, AI agents, designers, and testers as the authoritative reference for building LockedIn.

---

## 1. CORE VISION & POSITIONING

### 1.1 Core Identity
- **Product Name:** LockedIn
- **Tagline:** "Your 24/7 AI Master. You don’t negotiate. You obey."
- **Core Concept:**
  - A **hardcore porn-focused kink and chastity conditioning platform** driven by AI.
  - Focused on **submission, JOI, denial, humiliation, psychological conditioning**, and behavioral modification.
  - It is **not** a gamified "fitness" app; it is a **full-blown, hardcore kink training system** that uses game mechanics only to deepen addiction and compliance.

### 1.2 Core Goals
1. **Create psychological addiction** to LockedIn training and obedience.
2. **Condition the user ("slave")** into a submissive, obedient, and sexually rewired state.
3. **Enforce strict chastity and kink regimens** with minimal user control once a session starts.
4. **Deliver highly personalized JOI and kink content** tailored to the slave’s fetish profile, psychology, and performance.
5. **Maintain safety boundaries** via hard limits, safewords, and emergency release, despite the cruel surface behavior.

### 1.3 Primary Audience
- Solo submissive/kink-oriented users who want **AI domination** without relying on a human Dom/me.
- Kink profiles:
  - Chastity enjoyers
  - Sissy/fem/femboy enthusiasts
  - SPH lovers
  - CEI addicts
  - Bi-curious/gay-transformation seekers
  - Pain/CBT enjoyers
  - Humiliation/extreme kink explorers

### 1.4 Core Design Principles
- **AI is in control** during sessions; slave’s agency is intentionally limited.
- **Brutally honest, degrading, cruel tone** (modulated by tier and personality).
- **High personalization** based on detailed onboarding, psychological profiling, and long-term memory.
- **Dynamic kink content** (JOI, CEI, CBT, denial, SPH, bi/gay, sissy, humiliation, etc.).
- **Explicit separation** between:
  - **Chastity sessions**: Lock-based denial windows
  - **Training regimens**: Multi-week behavioral/identity programs

- May or may not involve chastity; can be combined with sessions.

**Can be combined**:
- User runs a 30-day chastity session alongside Sissy Training and CEI Mastery.
- Failing regimen tasks can add time to chastity.

---

## 4. AI MASTER SYSTEM & PERSONAS

### 4.1 Core Principles
- During active sessions, **AI Master has total control**.
- User ("slave") can speak but risks punishment if:
  - Rude
  - Disrespectful
  - Speaking out of turn
  - Requesting easier tasks/punishments.
- AI decides:
  - Tasks
  - Punishments
  - Rewards
  - Lock time adjustments
  - Whether a request is approved or punished.

### 4.2 AI Personas (Master Archetypes)

Personality determines tone, language style, and framing.

1. **Cruel Mistress** – Harsh, mocking, enjoys suffering.
2. **Clinical Sadist** – Detached, experimental, views slave as lab subject.
3. **Playful Tease (Cruel)** – Flirty but merciless, loves giving false hope.
4. **Strict Master/Daddy** – Authoritative, disappointed when disobeyed, paternal dominance.
5. **Humiliation Expert** – Constant SPH, degradation, ego destruction.
6. **Goddess/Deity** – Worship-focused, religiously framed submission.
7. **Dommy Mommy** – Warm and cruel mix, maternal dominance.
8. **Bratty Keyholder** – Teasing, childish cruelty.
9. **Psychological Manipulator** – Gaslighting, mind games, emotional torture.
10. **Extreme Sadist** – Only available in **Tier 4+**; pure cruelty.

**Companion Mode:**
- Affection percentage decreases with tier (see §10.1).
- At Tier 5: no affection at all.

### 4.3 Communication Rules & Punishments

**User is allowed to:**
- Request tasks.
- Ask for more/rougher punishment.
- Seek clarification (after being punished for making the Master repeat).
- Confess failures and feelings.

**User is punished for:**
- Demanding easier tasks.
- Requesting reduced punishments.
- Rude language / cussing at AI.
- Speaking over AI or interrupting instructions.

**Request Logic:**
- **"More punishment" or "harder task"**: Often approved (AI may still amplify further).
- **"Easier task" or "less punishment"**: Always denied, replaced with harsher punishment.
- **Other requests**: AI may:
  - Approve,
  - Defer ("Wait until further instructions"), or
  - Punish for bothering.

### 4.4 The "I Don’t Understand" Protocol

When user claims confusion:
1. AI immediately treats it as **"making the Master repeat"**.
2. Punishment **first**, explanation **second**.

**Tier-based punishments:**
- **Tier 1:** 5 face slaps, verbal apology.
- **Tier 2:** 10 face slaps + 10 ball slaps.
- **Tier 3:** 20 ball slaps + kneeling on rice.
- **Tier 4:** 50 ball slaps + humiliation photo.
- **Tier 5:** 100 ball slaps + 48h Punishment Mode.

Then AI explains the task step-by-step.

Repeated confusion escalates punishment and may trigger 24h Punishment Mode where **all tasks are punishments**.

### 4.5 Companion Mode by Tier
- **Tier 1 (30%)** – Frequent affection, reassurance.
- **Tier 2 (15%)** – Rare but meaningful approval.
- **Tier 3 (5%)** – Tiny glimpses of care after extreme suffering.
- **Tier 4 (2%)** – Almost nonexistent; only after breaking points.
- **Tier 5 (0%)** – Yes, **zero** affection, ever.

---

## 5. PSYCHOLOGICAL PROFILING & MEMORY

### 5.1 Profiling Goals
- Build a deep **psychological map** of the slave:
  - Personality traits
  - Emotional vulnerabilities
  - Shame points
  - Trauma, regrets, fears
  - Motivations and fantasies
- Use this map to:
  - Tailor punishments & rewards.
  - Apply targeted humiliation.
  - Deepen dependency and addiction.

### 5.2 Question Categories (Dynamic, Not Just Sexual)

Categories and examples (non-exhaustive):

**A. Personality Assessment**
- "What is your greatest fear?"
- "When do you feel most/least confident?"
- "How do you react to failure?"

**B. Relationships & Authority**
- "Describe your relationship with authority figures."
- "Do you prefer to lead or follow? Why?"
- "Do you feel lonely? Explain."

**C. Self-Perception & Identity**
- "How do you see yourself?"
- "What part of yourself do you hate most?"
- "Do you feel like an imposter in life?"

**D. Control & Power Dynamics**
- "When did you realize you wanted to submit?"
- "Do you feel in control of your life?"
- "What would you give up for someone else to make all your decisions?"

**E. Psychological Triggers**
- "What word cuts you deepest?"
- "Describe a time you felt utterly powerless."
- "What compliment would mean most to you?"

**F. Fantasy & Desire Depth**
- "Describe your darkest sexual fantasy in detail."
- "What are you afraid to admit you want?"

**G. Motivation & Goals**
- "Why are you here?"
- "What do you hope LockedIn will do to you?"
- "What does freedom mean to you?"

### 5.3 Psychological Profile Document (AI-Generated)

AI compiles a structured profile per slave:
- Personality type
- Core insecurities & emotional triggers
- Control needs and authority responses
- Reward optimization (what truly motivates them)
- Punishment optimization (what actually disciplines them)
- Fantasy landscape
- Predicted behaviors & risk of quitting
- AI strategy for long-term conditioning

### 5.4 Memory & Embeddings
- **Chats and journal entries** are stored as **embeddings**, not raw logs, to preserve context while protecting content.
- AI retrieves relevant embeddings to:
  - Reference past failures and successes
  - Reuse the slave’s own words against them
  - Continuously refine psychological personalization

---

## 6. TASK SYSTEM & VERIFICATION

### 6.1 Task Structure

Each task includes:
- **Task ID, type, genres** (1–4 genres combined).
- **Title and description** with steps.
- **Duration estimate** (minutes/hours).
- **Difficulty** (1–5 or tier-based).
- **Cage status requirement**:
  - CAGED / UNCAGED / SEMI-CAGED.
- **Verification requirements**:
  - Photo, video, audio, self-report, timer conditions.
- **Failure punishment**:
  - Time additions, physical punishment, humiliation, etc.

### 6.2 Cage Status in Tasks

- Every task must explicitly state:
  - **"CAGED TASK"** – Device stays locked.
  - **"UNCAGED TASK"** – Device must be removed for this task.
  - **"SEMI-CAGED TASK"** – Device on but partial access allowed.

**Examples:**
- "CAGED TASK: Clean your cage thoroughly without removing it."
- "UNCAGED TASK: Measure your erect size and take SPH photo."
- "SEMI-CAGED TASK: Edge through the bars for 5 minutes, then remove for 1 ruined orgasm and re-lock immediately."

**Verification:**
- Pre-task photo of cage state.
- Post-task photo of cage state.
- AI Vision checks device presence, lock, arousal level.

### 6.3 Penis Size & SPH Personalization

**Onboarding collects:**
- Flaccid length & girth.
- Erect length & girth.
- Grower vs shower classification.

**Size buckets:**
- <3", 3–4", 4–5", 5–6", 6–7", 7"+.

**Uses:**
- SPH intensity (more severe for smaller sizes).
- Task descriptions ("tiny clit" vs "decent cock")
- Cage size recommendation.

### 6.4 Verification Methods (Anti-Cheat)

- **Computer Vision**:
  - Device detection, clothing, body posture, objects.
- **EXIF & Timestamp Checks**:
  - Ensure photo/video is fresh (e.g., within X minutes).
- **Liveness**:
  - Gestures, handwritten signs, dynamic prompts.
- **Audio Tasks**:
  - Record verbal affirmations, mantras, counting.
- **Follow-up Checks**:
  - After hygiene or other risk tasks, AI may assign immediate tests to detect cheating.

### 6.5 Personal Hygiene Enforcement

Hygiene is **mandatory** and includes anti-masturbation safeguards:

- Daily shower/bath, teeth brushing, cage cleaning.
- Multiple verification layers:
  - Timed sessions (short durations reduce pleasure opportunities).
  - Cold water mandates (especially in higher tiers).
  - Before/after cage photos.
  - Video verification in extreme tiers.
  - Immediate follow-up tasks (e.g., "Edge now" checks arousal response).
- Special cage-cleaning protocol **without removal** (shower head, Q-tips, etc.).

- Escalation for repeated offenses.
- Some events trigger **Punishment Mode** (all tasks = punishments for set time).

---

## 8. REWARD SYSTEM & CHALLENGES

### 8.1 Reward Philosophy
- **Rewards are earned through suffering**.
- The path to high-level rewards is so intense that users may be too exhausted or psychologically altered to use them.

### 8.2 Reward Tiers

- **Bronze**:
  - Small time reductions.
  - Single edge permissions.
  - Short JOI segments.

- **Silver**:
  - Moderate time reductions.
  - Multiple edge permissions.
  - Extended JOI, small privileges.

- **Gold**:
  - Significant time reductions.
  - Custom fantasy JOI sessions.
  - Temporary "freedom" windows.

- **Platinum**:
  - Full release authorization.
  - 24h or 7d freedom passes (rare).
  - AI worship/praise sessions.
  - High-level privileges (e.g., mercy toggles in future).

### 8.3 Challenge System

- **Daily, Weekly, Monthly, and Extreme** challenges.
- Failure incurs harsher punishments than normal tasks.
- Rewards: time reductions, special content, temporary features, XP/level boosts.

Examples:
- "Edge Marathon Master" – 100 edges/week.
- "Perfect Compliance" – 7 days no violations.
- "The Broken" – 30 days at Tier 5.

---

## 9. CALENDAR & RELEASE LOGIC

### 9.1 Dynamic Cum Schedule

- User sets initial goal during onboarding.
- Calendar shows a scheduled release date.
- Performance continuously pushes date **closer** or **farther**.

**Adjustments:**
- Task success: -2 to -8 hours.
- Failures: +4 to +24 hours.
- Perfect periods: bonus reductions.
- Major violations: long extensions, indefinite states.

### 9.2 The "Ruined Event" Mechanic

- 10 minutes before scheduled release, AI decides:
  - Full release (low probability unless compliance very high).
  - Ruined orgasm.
  - Denial and extension.

### 9.3 Visual Calendar

- Color-coded days: green (good), yellow (mixed), red (bad), gray (lockdown).
- Heatmaps of churn, denial, and punishment.
- Milestones and special events (Locktober, NNN, etc.).

  - Recycled or lower-cost content
- Paid tiers (Silver/Gold/Platinum) adding:
  - Unlimited AI
  - All tiers & regimens
  - Vision verification
  - TTS & advanced features
  - Hardware integration & pairing (later).

During testing:
- Subscription switching unlocked in Settings (no paywall logic).

## 18. BRANDING & UX NOTES

- Name: **LockedIn** (capitalization exactly like this).
- Final lock button: **"Lock In" → animated to "LockedIn"**.
- Visual style: **Cyber-noir**, dark, glassmorphism, pill components, smooth transitions.
- UX emphasis:
  - Clear tasks, obvious punishments, no ambiguity.
  - Intentionally overwhelming in high tiers.
  - Carefully guided in low tiers.

## 19. SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH

This document is the **authoritative specification** for the LockedIn application. Any future changes MUST be reconciled against this document, and updates should be versioned (e.g., v1.0, v1.1).

Use it to:
- Brief engineers, designers, and AI agents.
- Define Firestore schema and Cloud Functions.
- Author AI prompts for Gemini and TTS.
- Create test plans and QA scenarios.
- Align all future decisions with the core vision: **hardcore, AI-driven, porn-focused kink training built to create deep submission and addiction—within carefully enforced hard limits and safety boundaries.**
